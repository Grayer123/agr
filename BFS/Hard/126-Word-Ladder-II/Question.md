# 126. Word Ladder II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/)

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1.  Only one letter can be changed at a time
2.  Each intermediate word must exist in the word list

For example,

Given:  
_beginWord_ = `"hit"`  
_endWord_ = `"cog"`  
_wordList_ = `["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`  

Return  

<pre>  [
    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
  ]
</pre>

**Note:**  

*   All words have the same length.
*   All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

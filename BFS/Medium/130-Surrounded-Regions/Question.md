# 130. Surrounded Regions

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)

Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

For example,  

<pre>X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
</pre>

After running your function, the board should be:

<pre>X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
</pre>

# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree

<pre>    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
</pre>

as `"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"`, just the same as [how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

# 162. Find Peak Element

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)


A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array where **num[i] ≠ num[i+1]**, find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that **num[-1] = num[n] = -∞**.

**Example:** 
In array `[1, 2, 3, 1]`,   
`3` is a peak element and your function should return the index number `2`.

Note:
Your solution should be in **logarithmic** complexity.

# 278. First Bad Version

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.   
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.  
Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.  

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. 
Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should **minimize** the number of calls to the API.
